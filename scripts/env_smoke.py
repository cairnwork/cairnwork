"""Environment smoke test for onboarding an external repo to Cairnwork.

The slow part of trying Cairnwork on a new repo is not the AI task; it is finding
the environment couplings (writes next to the repo, git safe.directory, the venv's
python not on PATH, network) one at a time, each after a dispatched run fails. This
lists them all up front: run a repo's own already-green tests twice — once bare, and
once through Cairnwork's real verification path — and compare.

Accuracy comes from running the sandbox side through ``verifiers.run_verifiers``
itself (not a hand-rolled profile), so this measures exactly what verification does
and stays correct as that path changes (#33/#36/#40). ``account=None`` means no
VerifierAccount exclusive lock, so probes for different repos run in parallel on one
host. Only pytest repos are covered, because ``parse_verifier`` accepts only
``python3 -m pytest … tests/*.py`` (node/conda come later).

A repo is ENV_OK when its green tests stay green under the sandbox, ENV_COUPLING when
they pass bare but fail under the sandbox (the reason is classified from the verifier
log), and REPO_TESTS_NOT_GREEN when they do not pass bare — in which case the repo
cannot serve as an environment probe at all. A run that passes except for skipped tests is
SKIPPED_TESTS: the verifier rejects skips, so the target must name tests that run on this host.

Scope and honest limits:
- This probes the ``account=None`` path (same uid as the caller). Couplings that only
  appear when verification runs under a separate ``VerifierAccount`` (a different uid) —
  notably git ``safe.directory`` ownership and file-permission handoffs — are NOT covered
  here and can still surface on a real dispatch. A cross-uid probe is route (b), deferred.
- The bare run happens first and in no sandbox, so a test that writes a global resource
  (a fixed host port, ``/tmp/app.sock``, a shared cache) can leave state the sandbox run
  then reuses; and parallel probes can contend on such fixed resources. Keep tests
  hermetic, or lower ``workers`` / run serially when they are not.
