"""Property-based state-machine test for OwnershipLedger (preserved behaviors #6, #7).

Why this exists: unit tests check the paths the author thought of. This drives the
ledger through long random sequences of bind / resend / status-change operations
against a Python shadow model, and asserts the invariants that must never break —
the exact class of "tests pass but a guarantee silently fails" bug that this
project exists to avoid (docs/LESSONS_FROM_NEXUS.md).

Invariants asserted after every step:
  I1  at most one ACTIVE record per card_hash (status not in SUPERSEDED/CANCELLED);
  I2  the owner bound to a task never changes;
  I3  status only ever moves along TRANSITIONS;
  I4  an identical resend returns the same record and never re-runs (FAILED stays FAILED);
  I5  get/route never guesses — unknown ids raise OwnershipUnknown;
  I6  in_flight() is exactly our BOUND/DISPATCHED records (include_foreign: all of them);
  I7  an identical request under a new key and another card is refused while one is active
      (REPLAY_FORBIDDEN if COMPLETED/FAILED, else RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED).

Run: pytest tests/property/ -q   (or with mutmut to check these actually bite).
