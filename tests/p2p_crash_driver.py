"""Run one task with a P2P step in its own process, so a test can SIGKILL it during that step.

Usage: python p2p_crash_driver.py <repo> <state dir> <base> <test commit> <q|r|n> [account]
The candidate sets calc.SLOW, so the P2P candidate run (-q) sleeps. With 'r' the first P2P run is
replaced by a plain failure, so the re-run (-r) is the one that sleeps. With 'n' nothing sleeps:
the run finishes normally.
