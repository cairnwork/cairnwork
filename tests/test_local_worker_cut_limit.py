"""cut_900s with a turn that spans its limit (Codex review of PR #248, MUST-FIX 2; since #239).

cut_at kept only the turns ended by the limit, so a tool-running turn that started before it and
ended after it was dropped and tree_differs_at_limit reported the earlier state, which nobody
observed at the limit. It is now null then; turns_completed still counts only the turns ended by
the limit, and the validator recomputes both the same way.
