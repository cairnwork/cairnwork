"""Build v0.2 (#229) receipts the way verify_candidate does, with a fake Core and no sandbox.

A producer repository holds base, a head (one commit on base) and a test commit (one commit on
base); the executed tree is head with the tests laid over it, carried by a scratch commit only the
producer has. Receivers are fresh repositories that fetch only what they are given.
