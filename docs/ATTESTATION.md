# Cairnwork Change Attestation (Phase 1)

Cairnwork provides automated attestation of verified code changes by converting
its append-only notary records into in-toto Statement v1 documents.

## Verification Gate and Integrity Checks

A Statement is produced only after re-running the notary's verification rules and
confirming that all integrity invariants hold:
1. HTTP status code returned by Core is 200.
2. Verification status reported by Core is `"VERIFIED"`.
3. Integrity flag reported by Core is `"VALID"`.
4. Response echoed hashes match the four request component hashes (`acceptance_contract_hash`, `change_set_hash`, `verification_plan_hash`, `evidence_bundle_hash`).
5. Core identity in the response matches the expected Core identity.
6. Notary database row columns (`task_id`, `attempt_id`, `base_commit`, `candidate_commit`) match the bound request's `contract_id`, `change_set_id`, `source_revision`, and `target_revision`.
7. Candidate commit is supplied by the caller and compared independently against the record's candidate commit and notary verdict.
8. Recomputed `request_hash`: Must equal `"sha256:" + sha256(canonical_json(request))` as computed by the notary.
9. Recomputed commit bindings: The record's `candidate_commit` must equal `change_set.target_revision` (stripped of `git-commit:` prefix) and `base_commit` must equal `change_set.source_revision` (stripped of `git-commit:` prefix).

If any check fails or the notary verdict is not verified, statement creation is refused
with `RecordNotVerified` or `RecordMalformed`.

## In-Process Trust Boundary

The opaque type and re-checks defend against accidental misuse and against callers that only hold the public API; they do not defend against code running in the same process that bypasses them (`object.__setattr__`, direct SQLite writes); the signed envelope (next PR) binds the Statement bytes, and offline verification recomputes everything from the notary database and git objects.

## Statement Structure

An attestation statement is an unsigned in-toto v1 Statement containing:
- `_type`: `"https://in-toto.io/Statement/v1"`.
- `subject`: Identifies the candidate git revision under evaluation (exactly one entry):
  - `git-commit:<candidate>`: Target revision under evaluation.
- `predicateType`: Provisional type URI
  `https://cairnwork.github.io/attestation/verified-change/v0.1`, or `.../v0.2` for an external
  candidate verified with deferred tests (see "External candidates" below).
- `predicate`: A dictionary binding the execution outcome and provenance:
  - `base_commit`: Base revision against which the change was produced.
  - `request`: The complete generic verification request payload verbatim.
  - `response`: The complete Core verification response verbatim.
  - `request_hash`: The SHA-256 digest of canonical request JSON.
  - `http_status`: HTTP status code returned by the Core verifier (e.g., 200).
  - `status`: Verification verdict status (e.g., `"VERIFIED"`).
  - `integrity`: Integrity flag from Core (e.g., `"VALID"`).
  - `core_identity`: Reported Core identity from the verification response.
  - `verifier_observations`: Exact list of observations from the evidence bundle.
  - `hidden_test_commit`: Null in v0.1. In v0.2 the test commit the binding names.
  - `binding` (v0.2 only): the external candidate's binding (see "External candidates").
  - `test_source`: `"bundle"`, `"auto"` or `"none"`, the hidden-test mode the run itself used
    (the pipeline journals a `TEST_SOURCE` row in `journal.sqlite` before it checks the deferred
    tests; `statement` reads that row read-only by task and attempt, never `config.json`).
    `cairnwork-verify` writes the same row, in the same `journal.sqlite`, under its one-off
    `verify-...` task id (printed as `task_id` next to `attempt_id` in its JSON output); pass
    those two to `cairnwork-attest statement`.
    No row (the task had no hidden tests, or the run predates this change) is `none`.
    Confidentiality of the hidden tests is claimed only for `bundle`; `auto` and `none` make no
    such claim. A config changed after the run does not change the recorded value.
  - `producer`: Software identity and version generating the statement.
  - `recorded_at`: Timestamp when the notary recorded the verdict in SQLite.
  - `timestamp`: Caller-supplied UTC ISO-8601 generation timestamp.
  - `assurance`: Posture and isolation metadata.

## Assurance Semantics

The `assurance` object records the security boundaries and isolation posture
present during candidate evaluation. In Phase 1, typed request fields proving
isolation or execution posture do not exist in the recorded request payload,
so all five fields render `"unknown"`:
- `sandbox_backend`: `"unknown"` (no typed request field proves sandbox backend).
- `verifier_account_isolated`: `"unknown"` (no typed request field proves account isolation).
- `worker_isolated`: `"unknown"` (no typed request field proves worker isolation).
- `hidden_tests`: `"unknown"` (no typed request field proves hidden test evaluation).
- `network`: `"unknown"` (no typed request field proves network isolation posture).

Semantics rule: `"unknown"` means not evidenced. Boolean and enum fields default to
`"unknown"` unless positive or negative proof exists in direct typed request evidence.
Cairnwork never assumes or hard-codes `True` without direct evidence, and does
not accept unproven caller assertions.

- Core identity at re-verification: `verify_record` re-runs the notary's response binding against the Core identity of the *currently installed* `nexus-certify` unless the caller passes `core_identity=` explicitly. A record notarized under an older Core therefore reads as not verified (fail closed) until the caller supplies that Core's identity; the recorded response's own `core_identity` is carried in the predicate for that purpose.

## Signing (DSSE, Ed25519)

A Statement is signed by wrapping its canonical bytes (`statement_bytes`) in a
[DSSE v1](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse/blob/master/protocol.md)
envelope (`cairnwork_attest.dsse`):

```json
{
  "payloadType": "application/vnd.in-toto+json",
  "payload": "<base64 of the statement bytes>",
  "signatures": [{"keyid": "<sha256 hex of the raw public key>", "sig": "<base64>"}]
}
```

- Envelope top-level keys must be strictly the whitelist `payloadType`, `payload`, `signatures`; any extra top-level key fails envelope validation with `ENVELOPE_SHAPE`. Unknown fields inside the signed Statement payload may stay for forward compatibility.
- Public signing is performed via `sign_statement(verified: VerifiedRecord, *, producer: Producer, timestamp: str, private_key: Ed25519PrivateKey) -> dict`: it accepts only an in-process `VerifiedRecord`, builds the Statement via `build_statement`, serialises it with `statement_bytes`, and signs it. The raw-bytes signer is private (`_sign_bytes`).
- The Ed25519 signature covers the DSSE Pre-Authentication Encoding
  `PAE(payloadType, payload)` =
  `"DSSEv1" SP len(type) SP type SP len(payload) SP payload`, never the base64
  text or the JSON envelope, so the payload type is bound by the signature.
- `keyid` is SHA-256 (hex) of the 32-byte raw public key. It is only a hint for
  picking a signature; trust comes from the public key the verifier supplies.
- Multi-signature semantics: DSSE threshold-1 verification is used. The envelope
  verifies when ONE signature whose keyid names the trusted key verifies over PAE;
  other signatures (stale, unrelated, or malformed under other keyids) are ignored.
  `Verification` records `signature_index: int | None` (which entry in `signatures`
  verified). A malformed entry under the TRUSTED keyid still fails closed.
- Strict base64: For the payload and every signature `sig`, standard base64 alphabet
  only is accepted (matching regex `^[A-Za-z0-9+/]*={0,2}$`), decoded with validation,
  and canonical padding is required (`base64.b64encode(decoded) == original.encode()`).
  Urlsafe envelopes and non-canonical padding are refused on purpose (`PAYLOAD_NOT_BASE64`
  / `SIGNATURE_NOT_BASE64`).
- `verify(envelope, public_key)` returns `True` only when a signature whose
  `keyid` names that key verifies over PAE. Everything else is `False`
  (fail-closed); `verify_envelope` returns the same verdict with a reason code
  (`PAYLOAD_TYPE_MISMATCH`, `PAYLOAD_NOT_BASE64`, `SIGNATURES_MISSING`,
  `SIGNATURE_MALFORMED`, `SIGNATURE_NOT_BASE64`, `KEYID_MISMATCH`,
  `BAD_SIGNATURE`, `PUBLIC_KEY_INVALID`, ...) and, only on success, the
  authenticated payload bytes and `signature_index`. Consumers must read the
  Statement from that payload, not from an unverified envelope.

### Keys

`cairnwork_attest.keys` manages one Ed25519 key pair per state directory:

```bash
uv run python -m cairnwork_attest.keys generate --state <state-dir>  # prints keyid + public PEM
uv run python -m cairnwork_attest.keys public --state <state-dir>    # prints them again
```

- The private key is written to `<state-dir>/attest_ed25519.pem` (PKCS#8 PEM,
  unencrypted) with mode `0600`, created exclusively: an existing file or a
  symlink is never overwritten (`KEY_EXISTS`). Key creation is durable: `os.write`
  loops until the entire PEM is written, `os.fsync(fd)` is called before close,
  and the parent directory fd is fsynced after close. On any failure, the path is
  unlinked only if its `st_dev` and `st_ino` match the created file descriptor
  (never deleting a foreign file). Between `_safe_unlink`'s `stat` and `unlink`
  (both via the directory fd) the path can still be replaced by someone who can
  already write into the owner's 0700 key directory; that window is out of scope.
- Loading avoids check/use races: `load_private_key(state_dir)` opens the key file
  with `O_RDONLY | O_NOFOLLOW` directly, checks `os.fstat(fd)` for a regular file
  (`KEY_NOT_REGULAR`), no group/other permission bits (`KEY_PERMISSIONS_LOOSE`),
  matching owner `st_uid == os.getuid()` (`KEY_WRONG_OWNER`), and reads the PEM
  from that same file descriptor before closing it in `finally`. Missing files
  raise `KEY_NOT_FOUND`. There is no fallback key.
- Private keys never live in the repository or its tests; tests generate keys
  in memory or under a temporary directory.
- Not yet covered: key rotation, revocation, publishing the public key, and
  encrypting the key at rest (the state directory's permissions are the
  boundary).

## Offline Verification

Offline verification (`cairnwork_attest.verify.verify_bundle`) validates a DSSE
attestation bundle against local git repository objects and a trusted Ed25519
public key. Verification is completely fail-closed and runs with **no network access**.

`verify_bundle` returns a `VerifyResult(ok=bool, code=str, detail=str, statement=dict | None)`
and never raises exceptions for external input or verification failures. Bundle read
errors (missing file, oversize file, non-regular file) return `BUNDLE_UNREADABLE`;
strict-JSON decode failures return `BUNDLE_MALFORMED`; envelope structural problems
return `ENVELOPE_SHAPE`. Only programmer errors (such as wrong argument types) may raise.

### What Is Recomputed vs. What Is Trusted

- **What is trusted**:
  - Only the Ed25519 public key you supply.
  - The local git repository objects (`cat-file` and `diff-tree`).
  - Without a Core identity pin, the signing key vouches for the reported Core identity.
- **What is recomputed and checked** (in order, failing closed at the first violation):
  1. `BUNDLE_UNREADABLE` / `BUNDLE_MALFORMED` / `ENVELOPE_SHAPE` / `SIGNATURE_INVALID`: Bundle envelope is read using a single `os.open(path, O_RDONLY | O_NOFOLLOW | O_NONBLOCK)` call, verified with `fstat` to be a regular file with `st_size <= MAX` (4 MiB), and at most MAX+1 bytes are read from the fd (refusing if more arrives). Any missing file, oversize file, non-regular file, or read failure returns `BUNDLE_UNREADABLE`. Strict JSON decode failures (including duplicate keys) return `BUNDLE_MALFORMED`. The envelope must decode as strict JSON containing strictly `payloadType`, `payload`, `signatures` (any extra key → `ENVELOPE_SHAPE`), and its DSSE signature verified over `PAE(payloadType, payload)` using the supplied public key (`SIGNATURE_INVALID`).
  2. `STATEMENT_SHAPE`: Statement payload decodes as strict JSON with `_type == "https://in-toto.io/Statement/v1"`, `predicateType == "https://cairnwork.github.io/attestation/verified-change/v0.1"`, and an object `predicate`. Unknown fields inside the signed Statement may stay for forward compatibility.
  3. `SUBJECT_SHAPE`: Statement has exactly one subject entry with a valid 40-hex `gitCommit` digest, and `predicate.base_commit` is a 40-hex commit hash.
  4. `CANDIDATE_MISMATCH`: The Statement's subject `gitCommit` must equal `expected_candidate` (checked right after signature and shape checks). Verifying without pinning the candidate proves only that "some commit was verified".
     - `BASE_MISMATCH` (part of step 4): Only when the caller passes `--base <sha>` (`expected_base`): `predicate.base_commit` must equal it. Checked right after `CANDIDATE_MISMATCH`, so only a signed, well-shaped statement reaches the comparison. Without `--base` this check is skipped and behaviour is unchanged.
  5. `COMMIT_NOT_FOUND`: Both candidate and base commits exist in the target git repository (`git cat-file -e <sha>^{commit}`).
  6. `REQUEST_HASH_MISMATCH`: `predicate.request_hash` matches the recomputed SHA-256 digest of canonical JSON `predicate.request` using the notary digest rule.
  7. `COMMIT_BINDING_MISMATCH`: `predicate.request.change_set.target_revision` and `source_revision` match `git-commit:<candidate>` and `git-commit:<base>`.
  8. `MANIFEST_MISMATCH`: The change manifest is recomputed from raw git tree objects between base and candidate commits (`read_change_set`), and its canonical `change_manifest_hash` matches both `predicate.request.change_set.diff_hash` and `cairnwork_protocol.change_manifest_hash(predicate.request.change_manifest)`.
  9. `RESPONSE_NOT_VERIFIED`: The verification response reports status `"VERIFIED"` and integrity `"VALID"` with HTTP 200, echoes all five request hashes (`acceptance_contract_hash`, `change_set_hash`, `verification_plan_hash`, `evidence_bundle_hash`, and required `change_manifest_hash`), satisfies `response_binding_problem` against the response's reported `core_identity`, and matches `predicate.response.core_identity == predicate.core_identity` (both present, deep-equal).
  10. `CORE_IDENTITY_MISMATCH`: When an optional Core identity pin is provided (`--core-identity <json-file>` / `core_identity_pin`), it must match `predicate.response.core_identity`.

### CLI Usage

The `cairnwork-attest` CLI provides key management, statement creation, and offline verification:

```bash
# 1. Key generation: generate an Ed25519 signing keypair into the state directory
cairnwork-attest keygen --state <state-dir>

# 2. Statement creation: read verified notary record and build/sign statement bundle
cairnwork-attest statement --state <state-dir> --task-id <id> --attempt-id <id> --candidate <sha> --out bundle.json --sign

# 3. Offline verification: verify the signed bundle using public key and git repo
cairnwork-attest verify bundle.json --public-key <public-key.pem> --repo <git-repo> --candidate <sha> [--base <sha>] [--core-identity <json>]
```

`--candidate <sha>` is required with no default. The caller must decide and pass the candidate commit explicitly (for example, `--candidate "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"`). The tool refuses to guess the candidate from HEAD or the local environment because an attacker-controlled checkout must never be trusted to choose the candidate commit under evaluation.

Missing or malformed `--candidate` (not a 40-character hex commit SHA) produces a usage error, prints a message to stderr, and exits 2. Optional `--base <40-hex>` requires the statement's `predicate.base_commit` to equal it; a different base fails with `BASE_MISMATCH` (exit 1, `ok: false` under `--json`), and a malformed value (not exactly 40 lowercase hex) is a usage error like a malformed `--candidate` (exit 2). Without `--base`, output and exit code are unchanged. The `base` field in `verify --json` is still the base claimed by the bundle. The CLI prints which candidate it is checking against (`Candidate: <sha>`). On success, `verify` prints `OK <candidate>` and exits 0. On failure, it prints `<CODE>: <detail>` and exits 1.

`verify --json` also prints `test_source` (`"bundle"`, `"auto"`, `"none"`, or `null` when the bundle
lacks it, e.g. one signed before this field existed). The field is informational: `verify` does
not yet refuse `auto` bundles.

### No receipt without a comparison (#234)

A run whose base could not be compared (`status: "UNCOMPARABLE"` from `cairnwork-verify`, or a
worker attempt with reason `UNCOMPARABLE: <code>`) **never produces a receipt**. The decision is
made before Core is called, so there is no Core response, no notary record and nothing for
`cairnwork-attest statement` to sign; `statement` for that candidate fails as for any candidate
without a VERIFIED record. UNCOMPARABLE means "no evidence", never "verified" and never "blocked".

This includes `VERIFIER_ACCOUNT_UNUSABLE` (#234 PR-C): the verifier account cannot run its Python,
found by a precheck before the test commit is burned (`tests_consumed: false`, so the same test
commit can be retried) or by a base-stage run after it (`tests_consumed: true`). An account failure
during the candidate's own run is never UNCOMPARABLE; it stays an internal error or FAILED.

## External candidates (v0.2, Issue #229)

`cairnwork-verify run --test-commit` runs the verifiers on the candidate with the deferred tests
laid over it. That commit exists only in the run's scratch clone, which is deleted, and its id
contains a commit time, so no receiver could ever rebuild it. Such a run is therefore bound to
the **tree** that ran, and its receipt names the **PR head** (the candidate) as its subject:

- The Core request's `change_set.target_revision` is `git-tree:<executed tree>` (the pinned
  nexus-certify accepts tree targets and checks them against `change_manifest.target_tree`);
  the manifest is base commit -> executed tree.
- `binding` is a JSON object with `rule` (`"overlay-v1"`), `base`, `head`, `test_commit`,
  `test_paths` (sorted), `executed_tree` and `verifiers` (`[[id, argv], ...]`, the task's
  verifiers; tests P2P selects are not included), plus optional keys that are present only when
  non-empty (`cairnwork_attest.binding_extras`; a binding without them is byte-identical to one
  made before they existed). Two optional keys: `import_paths` (#292), the `--import-path`
  directories prepended to the verifiers' import path, in that order; and `blackbox_commitment`
  (#303), `"sha256:<64 hex>"`, the salted hash of the owner's `--blackbox` declaration (never
  the declaration or its answers).
  A third, `protection` (#303), is `"partial"` or `"blackbox"`, or on macOS `"partial_macos"` or
  `"blackbox_macos"`: what a VERIFIED verdict rests on (docs/SECURITY.md, "What a VERIFIED rests
  on"). It is absent for `"same_process_only"`. A receiver checks it, without the `_macos`
  suffix, against the required verifier ids in the signed Core request
  (`PROTECTION_LABEL_MISMATCH` when they disagree), refuses a level above `"same_process_only"`
  without a `blackbox_commitment` (`PROTECTION_UNCOMMITTED`), and reports it as
  `assurance.protection`.
- `"sha256:" + sha256(canonical JSON of binding)` replaces `acceptance_contract.requirements_hash`
  on this path only. Core's response echoes `acceptance_contract_hash`, so the chain binding ->
  requirements_hash -> contract -> Core response breaks if a binding is edited or taken from
  another run.
- The notary row (schema 3) keeps the binding in a nullable `binding_json` column and names the
  head as its `candidate_commit`; the notary refuses a binding that does not name the base and the
  tree of the commit the verifiers ran, or whose hash is not the contract's. Ledgers at schema 1
  or 2 are never migrated on open (#343): a `Notary` refuses them with `NOTARY_SCHEMA_OLDER`
  and writes nothing (`cairnwork-attest` verification reports it as `RECORD_MALFORMED`). The
  operator runs `cairnwork-verify --state DIR migrate-notary`, which writes a backup beside the
  ledger and then applies the `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` steps in one transaction; an older
  deploy pinned to that state cannot read it afterwards. `read_record` reads an unmigrated
  schema-2 ledger as is.
- Unchanged: the Issue runner (its PR head is the commit notarized; no binding), a verify run
  without `--test-commit` (bound to the candidate commit, v0.1), old rows and v0.1 bundles.
  External-candidate receipts signed before this change (subject = scratch commit) still cannot
  be verified by a receiver.

**overlay-v1** (`cairnwork.deferred_tests.overlay_tree`, the one function the verifier and the
receiver share): read head's tree into a private index, then for each test path take its entry in
the test commit, which must be a regular file (`100644` or `100755`; symlinks, gitlinks and
directories are refused, as are paths with an empty, `.` or `..` component or a `.git` component
in any case: `OVERLAY_UNSUPPORTED_ENTRY`), add or replace exactly that path with
`update-index --cacheinfo`, and `write-tree`. Plumbing only, so worktree, attributes and git
config play no part. A receiver in full mode writes the rebuilt tree objects (no refs) into its
repository.

### Verifying a v0.2 receipt

`cairnwork-attest verify` picks the mode by whether the receiver's repository holds the test
commit:

- **full**: the test commit is here. The executed tree is rebuilt from head and test commit with
  overlay-v1 and must equal the bound tree, and Core's manifest must equal base -> rebuilt tree.
- **confidential**: the test commit is not here (the tests stay secret). A policy is required.
  The claim is limited to: the signer states that it ran the policy-named test source on a tree
  whose non-test paths are byte-identical to head. Every non-test path of Core's manifest must
  equal base -> head; each test path must be added or modified as a regular file. The test
  contents and the overlay are not verified.

The **policy** is the receiver's own configuration (for verify-action: a protected path in the
receiving repository), never shipped by the submitter or read from the receipt:

```json
{"rule": "overlay-v1", "test_commit": "<40-hex>", "core_identity": {...}, "key_id": "<64-hex>"}
```

These four keys are required (strict JSON). Five keys are optional: `require_full` (a JSON
boolean, default `false`), `test_roots` (a non-empty list of root prefixes such as `"tests/"`:
each ends with `/`, does not start with `/`, and has no empty, `.` or `..` part) and
`import_paths` (a list, possibly empty, of the import paths the receiver expects the verifiers
to have run with, in order; a receipt without them counts as `[]`) and `blackbox_commitment`
(`"sha256:<64 hex>"` or `""`; what `cairnwork-verify --state DIR blackbox-commitment --blackbox
FILE` prints for the receiver's copy of the declaration; a receipt without one counts as `""`) and
`protection` (#303, strict mode on the receiver's side): the least level the receiver accepts,
one of `"same_process_only"`, `"partial_macos"`, `"partial"`, `"blackbox_macos"`, `"blackbox"`
(a pin without `_macos` accepts only the Linux grade). A receipt whose level is lower fails
with `UNPROTECTED`; a receipt without the key counts as `"same_process_only"`. Any other key is
malformed. An unreadable or malformed policy is a usage error (exit
2). `key_id` must be the key id of `--public-key`, `core_identity` is pinned like
`--core-identity` (both apply when both are given), and the receipt's test commit and rule must
equal the policy's. A policy can also be given in full mode. A v0.1 receipt under a policy fails
with `TEST_SOURCE_MISMATCH` (it binds no tests). A caller of the Python API that passes a policy
dict of the wrong shape gets `POLICY_MALFORMED`.

Without `--policy` a receiver cannot tell whether tests were required: a v0.1 receipt without
tests for the same head also verifies `OK`. Whenever the receiver requires tests, give
`--policy` (in full mode too).

```bash
cairnwork-attest verify bundle.json --public-key pub.pem --repo <clone> --candidate <PR head> \
  [--policy policy.json] [--base <sha>] [--core-identity core.json] [--json]
```

Checks run in this order and the first failure is reported:

1. signature (`SIGNATURE_INVALID`, also when the policy pins another key)
2. shape (`STATEMENT_SHAPE`, `SUBJECT_SHAPE`; an unknown `rule` is a shape failure)
3. policy present in confidential mode (`POLICY_REQUIRED`); a policy with `require_full: true`
   refuses confidential mode (`POLICY_FULL_REQUIRED`)
4. binding-hash chain (`REQUEST_HASH_MISMATCH`, `BINDING_HASH_MISMATCH`: requirements_hash, the
   contract Core echoed, and the request's target tree and source commit)
5. head: subject == binding head == `--candidate` (`HEAD_MISMATCH`; `COMMIT_NOT_FOUND` when absent)
6. base: binding base == predicate base (== `--base`) (`BASE_MISMATCH`), present (`BASE_NOT_FOUND`)
7. test source: `hidden_test_commit` and the policy's pins; in full mode the test commit is one
   commit on the base changing exactly `test_paths` (`TEST_SOURCE_MISMATCH`); with `test_roots`,
   every bound test path must start with one of the roots, in both modes (`TEST_ROOT_VIOLATION`);
   the binding's `protection` must be the level of the request's required verifier ids, without
   the `_macos` suffix (`PROTECTION_LABEL_MISMATCH`; absent means `"same_process_only"`), and a
   level above that needs a `blackbox_commitment` (`PROTECTION_UNCOMMITTED`); each optional
   binding key the policy pins must equal the receipt's (`IMPORT_PATHS_MISMATCH`,
   `BLACKBOX_COMMITMENT_MISMATCH`), except `protection`, which must be at least the pinned level
   (`UNPROTECTED`)
8. tree (full: `TREE_MISMATCH`, `OVERLAY_UNSUPPORTED_ENTRY`; `REBUILD_FAILED` when git cannot
   rebuild the tree in the receiver's repository, e.g. it is read-only, which says nothing about
   the receipt) or head-tree (confidential: `HEAD_TREE_MISMATCH`, `OVERLAY_UNSUPPORTED_ENTRY`)
9. Core verdict (`RESPONSE_NOT_VERIFIED`, `CORE_IDENTITY_MISMATCH`), as for v0.1

On success `verify --json` adds `assurance`, what the receiver checked itself (`null` for v0.1):
`mode` (`full`/`confidential`), `test_source` (`policy_pinned` with `--policy`, otherwise
`signer_choice`: the test commit the signer chose, which the receiver should read itself), `head`, `non_test_paths` (`verified` or
`verified_against_core_manifest`), `test_contents` (`verified` or `not_verified`), `overlay`
(`rebuilt` or `not_verified`), `verifier_runs` (always `signer_claim`) and `protection` (#303:
the binding's level, checked in step 7; `"same_process_only"` when the binding has none). Without `--json` the
same object follows the `OK` line. A verify-action that predates v0.2 refuses these receipts with
`STATEMENT_SHAPE` (closed, not open); the note is attached to the PR head, so `publish` is
unchanged. `check-run --repo` without a policy reports `POLICY_REQUIRED` when the tests are
absent. When `check-run --repo` verifies a v0.2 receipt, the summary adds an `Assurance` row right
after `Offline verification` with the same object as sorted `key=value` pairs, so a reader can see
for example `test_source=signer_choice`; v0.1 receipts, the signature-only path and failures add no
such row.

The notary also checks a v0.2 binding before it asks Core (defence in depth): the judged commit's
only parent must be the binding head, and rebuilding head overlaid with the test commit must give
the binding's `executed_tree`. Otherwise it records nothing and raises `NotaryInputError`.

Limits: tree and blob ids are SHA-1 (git's collision resistance); a test that reads commit
metadata (message, log) sees the scratch commit, which the binding does not cover.

## Publishing to a forge (Phase 2, step 1)

Once a signed bundle exists, `cairnwork-attest publish` delivers it to the forge by attaching it as a git note on a dedicated notes ref and pushing that ref to the remote. Signing and publishing are separate steps by design: `publish` takes an already-signed bundle, never calls Core and never modifies the candidate commit.

```shell
cairnwork-attest publish \
  --bundle attestation.bundle.json \
  --repo . \
  --candidate <sha> \
  --remote origin \
  --notes-ref refs/notes/cairnwork
```

The note stores the bundle bytes exactly (`git hash-object -w` + `git notes add -C`, so no whitespace normalisation). `cairnwork/verify-action` fetches `refs/notes/cairnwork` and reads the note for the candidate commit. `publish` never overwrites an existing note: the same bundle is a no-op (`NOOP`, exit 0), a different bundle for the same candidate is `NOTE_CONFLICT` (exit 1, left for a human). A push rejected as non-fast-forward (another publisher advanced the ref) is retried after re-fetching, up to `--max-attempts`; network or identity failures exit 2. No automatic notes merge strategy is used. The local notes ref is treated as a mirror of the remote: each attempt force-fetches it, so notes that exist only locally on that ref are discarded. `--remote` must be a configured remote name and `--notes-ref` must be under `refs/notes/`; anything else is rejected as `USAGE` before git runs. `--json` prints one line with `ok`, `code`, `detail`, `candidate`, `notes_ref`, `remote`, `attempts`, `blob` and `notes_tip` (the notes ref commit after the push; `null` when the push succeeded but the local tip could not be read, shown as `-` in the plain-text `PUBLISHED` line). When a push fails and the local notes ref cannot be restored, the code is `LOCAL_REF_RESET_FAILED` and `detail` carries both the restore and the push error.

## Check Run (Phase 2, informational)

After publishing, `cairnwork-attest check-run` posts a GitHub Check Run on the candidate commit so reviewers see the attestation facts in the pull request UI:

```shell
CAIRNWORK_GITHUB_TOKEN=... cairnwork-attest check-run \
  --bundle attestation.bundle.json \
  --repo-slug OWNER/NAME \
  --public-key attestation.pub.pem
```

The Check Run lists the candidate, base, SHA-256 of the signed Statement bytes, test source, key id and the offline verification result (with `--public-key` the signature is checked, reported as `VERIFIED, signature only`; add `--repo` to run the full `verify`; `--repo` needs `--public-key`; without a key the title is marked `UNVERIFIED` and the summary says the signature was not checked). A missing or malformed key file fails before anything is posted (`KEY_UNREADABLE` / `KEY_MALFORMED`), so an operator mistake never reads as a forged bundle. Its conclusion is always `neutral`: it is informational and never the enforcing gate. Enforcement stays with `cairnwork/verify-action`, which verifies the published note itself.

The token is read only from the environment variable `CAIRNWORK_GITHUB_TOKEN` (never a command-line argument) and is never printed. Use a GitHub App installation token with `checks: write`. Alternatively pass `--gh /abs/path/to/gh` (any `gh`-compatible CLI that authenticates by itself, such as a GitHub App helper): the request then goes through `<gh> api --method POST --include repos/OWNER/NAME/check-runs --input -`, no token is read from the environment, `CAIRNWORK_GITHUB_TOKEN` is removed from the `gh` child's environment, and `gh` authenticates with its own credentials (note that `gh` honours its own variables such as `GH_HOST` and `GH_TOKEN`, so the identity and host are whatever that `gh` is configured for). The path must be absolute and executable, otherwise the result is `USAGE`; a `gh` that prints no HTTP response (auth or network failure) reports `NETWORK_ERROR`. Bundle values enter the summary only when they have the expected shape (40-hex commits, 64-hex key id, a lowercase `test_source` word); anything else is shown as `invalid`, so no free text from the bundle reaches the pull request page. GitHub error messages are redacted of the token and reduced to plain text. Exit 0 means `CREATED`; usage, key, bundle, HTTP and network failures exit 2.

## On Verified (runner hook)

A runner calls `cairnwork-attest on-verified` once a task was verified. It runs `statement --sign`, `publish` and `check-run` in that order and stops at the first failing step (later steps are reported as `SKIPPED`):

```bash
cairnwork-attest on-verified --state /abs/state --task-id T --attempt-id A \
  --candidate <40-hex> --repo /abs/clone --repo-slug OWNER/NAME \
  [--remote origin] [--notes-ref refs/notes/cairnwork] [--out-dir /abs/dir] [--no-check-run]
```

The bundle is written to `<out-dir or STATE/attestations>/<task>-<attempt>.bundle.json` with mode 0600. Task and attempt ids must match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,63}`; paths must be absolute. A bundle already at that path is reused only if it fully verifies for this candidate (so a re-run publishes `NOOP`); any other file there fails with `BUNDLE_EXISTS`. The Check Run signature check uses the state's own public key. The token comes from `CAIRNWORK_GITHUB_TOKEN`; without it the `check_run` step is `USAGE` (the note is still published). `--gh /abs/path/to/gh` is passed through to the Check Run step, which then needs no token.

It prints one JSON line (sorted keys): `ok`, `task_id`, `attempt_id`, `candidate`, `bundle` and `steps` (`step`, `code`, `detail`). Exit 0 when every step that ran succeeded (statement `OK`, publish `PUBLISHED` or `NOOP`, check run `CREATED` or skipped by `--no-check-run`), 1 when publish returned `NOTE_CONFLICT`, 2 for any other failure. The token never appears in the output.

## Runner wiring (opt-in, default off)

The Issue runner can call an executable after a task's PR is open: set the state `config.json` key `post_verified_hook` to an absolute path (and optionally `post_verified_hook_seconds`, default 300). Unset, nothing runs and the runner behaves exactly as before. The intended hook is `cairnwork-attest on-verified`, which signs the statement, publishes the note and posts the informational Check Run; it needs a signing key in the same state directory (`cairnwork-attest keygen --state <state>`). Because the key names one executable (no subcommand or extra arguments), point it at a small wrapper:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
exec /abs/path/to/cairnwork-attest on-verified "$@"
# or, with a gh wrapper that authenticates by itself (no token in the hook):
# exec /abs/path/to/cairnwork-attest on-verified --gh /abs/path/to/gh "$@"
```

Make the wrapper executable (`chmod 700`) and keep it owned by the runner account.

The hook runs only in the verified branch, after the PR, labels and comment are final, so it can never change the outcome. It gets the task, attempt, candidate, clone and `OWNER/NAME` as arguments, and only `PATH`, `HOME`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `CAIRNWORK_GITHUB_TOKEN` (from the runner's own environment) and the git settings that let its notes push authenticate with the same `gh` credential helper as the runner's branch push. Every run is recorded in `<state>/post-verified-hook.jsonl` (token redacted); a failure, timeout or missing executable also prints one `ALERT post_verified_hook ...` line on stderr. The hook runs in its own session, so a timeout kills whatever it started too. The log is only appended to when it is a private (0600, owned by the runner) single-link regular file; anything else is alerted and skipped. The runner's printed result and exit code are exactly what they are with the hook off. A crash after the Issue is labelled done and before the hook runs does not lose the hook: settle writes an owed marker (`<state>/issues/<repo>__<n>__<task id>.hook-owed.json`, one per task) before it moves the label and drops it once the hook step has run (a step an error skipped, such as an unreadable config or an exception before the hook ran, keeps it), and a later pass runs every owed hook whose Issue it did not find still running (so still only after the labels are final). This is at least once: a crash after the hook and before the marker is dropped runs it again, and that second run is recorded in the log like any other (`cairnwork-attest on-verified` then reuses the bundle it already wrote).

## Planned Follow-ups (Phase 2+)

The following capabilities and gaps are explicitly deferred:
- Sigstore signing and transparency log integration.
- Enforcing forge status (the notes push is `cairnwork-attest publish`; the informational Check Run is `cairnwork-attest check-run`).
- `hidden_test_commit` for the Issue runner: bound for external candidates (v0.2) only.
- Execution log hashes: verifier argv is bound for external candidates (v0.2); log digests are not.
- Sandbox profile hash: Not carried in the notary record or evidence bundle.
- Timestamp validation: Timestamp is caller-supplied and not validated as UTC or against a trusted timestamping authority.
