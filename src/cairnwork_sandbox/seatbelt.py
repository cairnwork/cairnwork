"""macOS Seatbelt (sandbox-exec) confinement for running untrusted candidate code.

Rules learned from Nexus-new (docs/LESSONS_FROM_NEXUS.md; knowledge
nexus/research/2026-10-19-layer1-policy-sandbox-L1):

- default deny; reads only from an allow-list (system libraries, the Python
  installation, the checkout); writes only to the checkout and a per-run
  directory; no network; credential stores denied again as the last rules;
- the binary is called by absolute path and probed with a real run;
  when it is missing or broken the caller must fail closed (``available``
  returns False and nothing runs unconfined);
- every path is resolved to its real path (``/tmp`` and ``/var`` are symlinks)
  and checked for characters that could rewrite the policy;
- ``/dev/null`` must be writable or pytest dies with INTERNALERROR.

Known gap: a confined process can still read the arguments and environment of
other processes run by the same user (sysctl KERN_PROCARGS2); no Seatbelt rule
tried blocked it. Running under a separate uid does: see cairnwork/verifier_account.py.

File metadata (stat) is readable everywhere: Python cannot start without it.
That leaks names, sizes and times, not contents. Seatbelt is a macOS tool
Apple documents as legacy; it confines, it is not a portable production sandbox.
