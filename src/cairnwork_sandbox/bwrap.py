"""Linux bubblewrap (bwrap) confinement for running untrusted candidate code.

The policy is a read-only bind of the whole root plus read-write binds for the write roots,
with a fresh /dev and /proc, every namespace unshared (so no network), all capabilities
dropped and nested user namespaces disabled. Named credential directories under $HOME (and the
/run/user, /tmp/.X11-unix and /run/libvirt socket trees) are emptied with a tmpfs, credential
files are replaced by /dev/null, and root-equivalent daemon socket files (Docker/Podman/
containerd, the system D-Bus, LXD, Incus) are replaced by /dev/null — a read-only root bind does
not stop connect() to a pathname socket, which no network namespace covers (an X server likewise
lets a reachable client inject input and run commands outside the sandbox). See docs/SECURITY.md
for the full set.

Trade-off (documented in docs/SECURITY.md): until the verifier runs under its own account
(P4) the sandbox runs as the invoking account, so everything that account can read is
readable inside; only the named credential list and daemon sockets are masked. Other users'
0700 home directories are protected by POSIX permissions. This is not complete read isolation,
and the general pathname-socket surface under the whole-root bind closes only with P4.

On Ubuntu 24.04+ an AppArmor rule restricts unprivileged user namespaces by default:
``unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`` still succeeds but the new namespace holds no capabilities, so
mounting a fresh ``/proc`` or a bind fails. Lifting ``kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns``
(or, on an end user's machine, loading an AppArmor profile that grants ``userns``) makes
confinement work.

``available()`` probes with a real run: unshare a user and pid namespace with every
capability dropped and nested userns disabled, bind the root read-only and mount a fresh
``/proc``, then run ``true`` — the same hardening the real policy uses, so a build that
rejects one of these flags fails the probe instead of passing it and erroring on the real run.
The probe always mounts ``/proc`` on purpose: a probe that only binds the root passes on a
host where a nested ``/proc`` still fails, which would turn a dead backend into a false green.
When bwrap is missing or broken, callers run nothing (there is no unconfined fallback).
