"""What the Cairnwork core needs from an OS sandbox, independent of the platform.

The core (src/cairnwork) calls only this interface; each backend module holds the
platform specifics (binary paths, policy language, host directories). A backend
confines untrusted candidate code: default deny, reads only from the system, the
interpreter and the given read roots, writes only to the given write roots, no
network, credential stores denied. Callers must fail closed: when ``select()``
returns None nothing runs, and there is never an unconfined fallback.
