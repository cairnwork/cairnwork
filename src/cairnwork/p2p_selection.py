"""Pick the existing (pass-to-pass) tests to run alongside a task's own verifiers (#117).

A task's author declares the fail-to-pass verifiers that must pass on the candidate. Those
catch "did the change do the job", not "did the change quietly break something that already
worked". Widening runs EXISTING tests (ones that pass on the base) over the candidate too.

This module is pure selection: given the files a candidate may change, the test files that
exist on the base and a mode, it returns the test files to consider. It runs nothing and
knows nothing about pass or fail; p2p.py finds which of them pass on the base.

Modes (state config ``p2p_selection``):

* ``off`` - no widening; only the author's verifiers run.
* ``whole-suite`` (default) - every existing test file under the test roots.
* ``module-dir`` - the tests in the directories that hold a test for a changed file. A changed
  file maps to a test by mirror (strip a leading ``src`` and the top-level package, look in
  ``<test_root>/<remaining dirs>``) or by name (``test_<stem>.py`` / ``<stem>_test.py``
  anywhere under the roots). Every test directly in a matched test's directory is selected:
  on a flat layout ``tests/test_base.py`` brings in its sibling ``tests/test_sibling.py``
  (the regression #117 is about). A changed file that maps to nothing selects the tests
  directly in the test roots, never the whole tree. Changed test files are not sources. A selected
  directory with more than ``MODULE_DIR_CAP`` test files contributes only the files named after a
  change (#333: whole flat directories of a large repo made the base probe time out); the cut
  directories are recorded in the P2P rule (``cap_note``), so a cut to nothing is visible.
