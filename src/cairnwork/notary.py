"""Core notarisation with an append-only record (preserved behaviors #16-#18).

Only a nexus-certify response with HTTP 200, status VERIFIED, integrity VALID
and hashes that match the request Cairnwork built counts as verified. Every
other outcome, including an exception while calling Core, is recorded and is
not verified.

The notary builds the Core request itself from the task's acceptance spec, the
git change set and Cairnwork's verifier observations, so a verdict is always
bound to one exact change. It reads the change set from git itself (callers
pass a repository and two commit ids, never a change set), and the stored row
keeps the full request, the base and candidate commits, and its digest. Every
reader must name the candidate commit it holds: ``verdict(..., expected_candidate=)``
is required, and a row whose columns disagree with its stored request is not
verified.

The record is append-only: one row per (task_id, attempt_id), enforced by a
UNIQUE constraint and by triggers that abort UPDATE, DELETE and any INSERT
(including INSERT OR REPLACE from any connection) for an attempt already recorded. The
first outcome of an attempt is final. Calling ``notarize`` again for the same
attempt with the same request returns it without calling Core; with a
different request it raises AttemptRequestMismatch. Changed evidence needs a
new attempt. This avoids Nexus-new's INSERT OR REPLACE, where a later VERIFIED
could hide an earlier FAILED_VERIFICATION (Nexus-new#2776).
