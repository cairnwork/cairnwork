"""The candidate-judging phase of one attempt, split out of pipeline.py for the 400-line cap.

``tests_with_teeth`` checks a task's deferred tests really fail on the base; ``judge_candidate``
runs the verifiers over the candidate and has Core notarise it. Both take everything they need as
arguments (no module-level state) and are called by ``pipeline._attempt``; ``judge_candidate`` is
also shared with ``verify_candidate``. They never call back into ``pipeline``, so there is no cycle.
Behaviour is unchanged — this is a move, not a logic change.
