"""Run a task's verifiers on a fresh checkout of the candidate (preserved behaviors #5, #14).

Verifiers come from the task, so they are untrusted text. Only one shape is
accepted: ``python3 -m pytest [-q] [-p no:cacheprovider] tests/<file>.py[::<name>]...``.
Anything else is rejected before it runs, and nothing goes through a shell.

Each run happens in a new clone of the candidate commit made from Cairnwork's repository (never
in the worker's clone), with a minimal environment (no GIT_*, no inherited credentials, HOME and
TMPDIR inside the run directory, bytecode and the pytest cache disabled) and a timeout. A
verifier passes only if it exits 0 and, at the end, the checkout matches the candidate tree: a
final comparison (treecompare.py) of paths, bytes, symlink targets and the owner-execute bit. It
does not cover the top-level .git (the verifier's scratch: never used by the owner afterwards),
files next to the checkout, times, ownership, link counts or other mode bits, and a change made
and undone during the run is not seen. Under a verifier account the checkout is the account's
own copy: a test may write, utime and chmod it, and it is compared, as in owner mode (#240,
account_checkout.py).
The pytest run must also leave a JUnit report showing at least one test run and none failed,
errored, skipped or xfailed. pytest's configuration is pinned to a Cairnwork-owned ini with
rootdir and confcutdir at the checkout, so no ini in the candidate or a parent directory
applies, and plugin autoloading is off; the ini holds only allow-listed keys from the task's
base commit and plugins load by explicit -p (pytest_config.py). Output streams to a log file
with a size cap, the run's process group is killed afterwards, and logs and reports live in a
private directory, created with O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW. A process that starts its own session escapes
the group kill; only a sandbox stops that. The observation hash binds the candidate commit,
verifier id, full argv, exit code, timeout, mutations, test result and log hash.

The run is confined with macOS Seatbelt (see cairnwork_sandbox): no network, reads only
from the system, the interpreter and the checkout, writes only to the checkout
and a per-run directory. Without a working sandbox-exec nothing runs and the
verifier fails (no unconfined fallback). Logs, the pytest ini and the profile
live outside what the child may write. The candidate's code still runs in the
same process as pytest, so it can forge the report inside the per-run
directory; a pass is evidence, not proof.

Known gap: Seatbelt does not stop a sandboxed process from reading other
processes' arguments and environment (sysctl KERN_PROCARGS2) when they run as
the same user, so tokens in other processes' environments are readable and could
be printed into the verifier log. A VerifierAccount closes that (another uid);
any process the account still runs after a verifier is killed and fails the run,
and none may run before the next one. Without one, a process that leaves the
run's process group is killed only if it still carries the run token in its
environment. Either way, never pass raw verifier logs to a worker or a model.
Python runs with ``-P`` so the checkout is never on ``sys.path`` before the real
pytest (a root ``pytest.py`` cannot replace it). Callers must keep tests,
pytest configuration and shadowing root-level modules out of the files a candidate
may change (``protected_verifier_inputs``), but that is not enough on its own:
candidate source code also runs inside the pytest process and can forge a
result.
