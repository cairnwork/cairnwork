"""A worker that asks an Agy (Antigravity CLI) model to edit the attempt clone.

The model runs in print mode with ``--mode accept-edits --sandbox`` and the
clone as its working directory. What that actually allows was probed on
2026-10-20 (docs/DRILLS.md); it is not a security boundary. Cairnwork never
trusts the worker: it snapshots only the allowed files and rejects any other
change in the clone.
The agy process runs in its own process group, which is killed afterwards. It
gets only the environment it needs: it signs in from files under HOME (checked
2026-10-20), plus locale, config dirs, CA bundles and proxies. Other variables in
Cairnwork's environment do not reach it; proxy URLs may carry credentials, and
agy can read anything under HOME, so this narrows exposure, it is no boundary.
Its output is copied into the log by the parent, capped like a verifier log; a
process it started outside its group is killed if it still carries the attempt
marker, and one that still holds the output afterwards fails the run.
With an account-pool dispatcher configured (agy_dispatch.py) the worker runs that
instead of agy, prompt on stdin, same environment plus the pool's tuning variables.
With ``agy_run_as_user`` set as well, the dispatcher runs agy as that worker account,
and the attempt succeeds only if the dispatcher's worker receipts prove it ran as that
account and was swept clean; a run left behind by a killed dispatcher is swept through
the wrapper (agy_receipts.py).
