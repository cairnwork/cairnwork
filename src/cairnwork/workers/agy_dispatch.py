"""An operator-configured account-pool dispatcher in front of the agy worker.

On a host where several processes share a pool of agy accounts, the operator
names an executable (state ``config.json`` key ``agy_dispatch``) that picks the
account, holds its lease and rotates on quota. It takes the model, mode, working
directory, timeouts and one ``--write-path`` per allowed file, reads the prompt
on stdin and prints one status line on stderr: ``STATUS_PREFIX`` plus a JSON
object. Exit 75 with status ``pool_exhausted`` means no account in the pool has
quota left; that is an environment failure of its own and never a reason to try
another model.

With ``run_as_user`` set (state config ``agy_run_as_user``, Issue #183) the
dispatcher gets ``--run-as-user=<account>`` and runs only the agy process as that
account, through ``sudo`` and the wrapper ``agy-worker-exec`` in a per-run copy of
the clone; account selection and leasing stay with the dispatcher. Whether the run
really ran as that account, and was swept clean, is read from the dispatcher's
worker receipts (agy_receipts.py), never guessed; when the dispatcher reports that
the account, wrapper or copy-back refused, the attempt fails with
``WORKER_ACCOUNT_FAILED``. Agy is never run as the owner instead.
