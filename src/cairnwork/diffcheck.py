"""Name the ``git diff --check`` findings in a DIFF_CHECK_FAILED refusal (#227).

What can reach the message: only the text of a header line ``<path>:<line>: <kind>`` that git
printed, where ``path`` is exactly one of the change's own paths and ``kind`` is a known git
``--check`` message (or ", "-joined known stems ending in one "."). At most 5 entries, each
stripped of control, format and line-separator characters and cut at 120 characters.

What cannot: candidate text. git's output is read as raw bytes and split on b"\n" only, so a CR
embedded in a candidate line stays inside its ``+content`` line, which is never a header. A
forged header needs a newline, which a content line cannot hold. Output that is not strict UTF-8
or holds no valid entry gives the old text unchanged.
