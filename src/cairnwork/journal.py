"""Append-only attempt journal: what a run was about to do, written before it does it.

Recovery (recovery.py) reads the last phase of each attempt to decide what a crash
left behind. Rows are never updated or deleted (triggers), so a crash can only
lose the step it was in, never rewrite history.

TEST_SOURCE stays a journal phase (Issue #175): recovery treats it like any phase between
CANDIDATE and VERIFYING (a crash right after it settles FAILED, INTERRUPTED_AFTER_TEST_SOURCE;
no Core verdict can exist yet), and cairnwork_attest reads it. Opening a journal that predates it
migrates the table, the append-only triggers and the indexes inside one transaction.
