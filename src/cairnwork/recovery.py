"""Restart recovery (preserved behavior #21): settle what a crash left behind.

Rules (from Nexus-new's experience, see docs/LESSONS_FROM_NEXUS.md):

- run only when no Cairnwork run is in progress: recovery needs the exclusive
  run lock (runlock.py), which the kernel releases when a run dies;
- never re-run an interrupted attempt. A task becomes COMPLETED only if Core
  already recorded a verdict that is verified for the candidate the journal
  names and the run had not already decided FAILED; every other in-flight
  task becomes FAILED with an INTERRUPTED reason.
  To try again, supersede it and submit a new key (pipeline.py);
- kill any worker the dead run left behind (found by its CAIRNWORK_ATTEMPT
  environment marker), look again until they are shown gone (``confined.confirm_gone``: a
  delivered SIGKILL is not a death), and remove the attempt's clones. A worker that ran as a
  worker account (journaled at WORKER_STARTED) is shown gone only when that account is idle.
  When they are not shown gone (the process table cannot be read: SWEEP_UNAVAILABLE; or
  survivors, hidden environments, a busy account) the Decision says so (``sweep_unavailable``,
  detail with the reason's code) and the recovery is not clean (route exits 4, as for leftover
  directories). The status decision does not change: a verdict Core recorded is bound to the
  candidate commit, and a process that outlived the run can neither alter it nor record
  another, so COMPLETED still stands; a task without such a verdict is FAILED either way
  (#189). A FAILED task is then also marked unswept, in the ledger transaction that makes it
  FAILED: it cannot be superseded, so its card cannot be taken over by a new attempt, until
  takeover.supersede has shown the processes gone (#244);
- settle each task on its own: one bad record is reported, not fatal, and
  recovery is idempotent, so it can run again after a crash during recovery.
