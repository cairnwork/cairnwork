"""Can the verifier account run its Python? A precheck with a reason (#234).

The stress replay lost 26 rows to a bare "not usable": the venv sat under a 0750 home. ``walk``
says for each directory on the way to the interpreter (as configured and as really located)
whether the account's uid and groups may traverse it; ``blocked`` names the first that blocks,
e.g. ``/Users/james 0750 james:staff not traversable by cairnwork-verifier``. Mode bits only, no
ACLs: a hint. ``precheck`` takes its verdict from ``VerifierAccount.available()``, before anything
is spent; a failure is UNCOMPARABLE ``VERIFIER_ACCOUNT_UNUSABLE``, never success.
