"""Run existing (pass-to-pass) tests over a candidate next to the task's own verifiers (#117).

After the worker is done, for a task with deferred tests: select existing test files by the
state's ``p2p_selection`` mode (p2p_selection.py), run them on the BASE to find the tests that
pass there, then run exactly those on the judged commit as one more verifier (``p2p-<mode>``)
that Core must see pass. A test that already failed or was skipped on the base is not a
regression and is left out.

Failure paths, none of which can end VERIFIED:

* base probe times out, cannot report, or its report exceeds the size cap (a suite too large for
  one guard report, #184: ``base-probe-report-over-cap``) in ``whole-suite``: degrade to
  ``module-dir`` once and say so in the record; when ``module-dir`` itself cannot be probed, or
  would run the same files again, or selects no test file at all, or none of its tests passes on
  the base, the task is UNCOMPARABLE (``P2P_BASE_PROBE_UNUSABLE``, #234: no evidence, never
  verified; a degraded probe never turns into "nothing to run"). A probe that worked but found no
  base-passing test is only recorded (``targets: 0``);
* the candidate run times out: its observation is not a pass, so Core says not verified;
* the candidate run fails only because a test failed (``VerifierRun.plain_failure``: no timeout,
  mutated checkout, surviving process or oversized log, and the guard reported a failed test):
  it is re-run once (flaky rule). A pass on the re-run is what Core sees, with the first run's
  failing tests and integrity signals recorded in the rule (``rerun``) and ``p2p_rerun_passed``
  set, so a clean pass and a pass after re-run can be told apart (the verdict is the same); a
  second failure is what Core sees, so not verified. Any other failed run blocks as it is,
  without a re-run;
* the p2p verifier id clashes with an author verifier: REFUSED.

Before the worker starts, ``base_env_check`` probes the ``module-dir`` files on the unchanged base
the same way; a probe failure there is UNCOMPARABLE ``BASE_ENV_FAILED`` (environment, #234).

``p2p_time_budget_seconds`` bounds each run (probe, degraded probe, candidate run, re-run).
The rule actually used is a dict (``P2PPlan.rule``): it goes into the p2p observation's artifact
hash (so Core's record binds it), into ``p2p-selection.json`` beside the verifier log, and into the
task result. Core's notarisation contract is unchanged.
