"""Trusted verdict for a verifier run (preserved behavior #14; b063 report-forgery research).

The pass/fail comes from a pytest plugin that records what pytest itself collected and how
each test ended, written once at ``sessionfinish`` — not from a JUnit file the candidate can
write. verifiers.py used to pass ``--junitxml=<path>`` in argv and read that file, but the
candidate's own code runs in the same process and could read the path from ``sys.argv``, write
a passing report and ``os._exit(0)`` before the real tests ran. The parent now accepts a run
only when our record is present (so an exit before ``sessionfinish`` fails), it names at least
one collected test, every collected test has a result, and all of them passed.

The plugin is a small standalone module (``_PLUGIN_SOURCE``) materialised into a per-run
directory by ``install_plugin`` and loaded with ``-p``. It carries no cairnwork import, so it
loads even when cairnwork is not importable from inside the sandbox (an editable checkout under
a 0700 home the verifier account cannot traverse); that directory is read-only to the sandbox,
so the candidate cannot replace it.

What this does and does not do. It removes the old trivial attack (read ``--junitxml`` from
argv, write a passing report) and makes the verdict reflect what pytest itself collected and
ran. It defeats a candidate that only writes a forged JUnit (now ignored) or only calls
``os._exit`` without writing a record. It does NOT stop a candidate that reads the nonce and
path from the environment, writes a matching record and exits — reading the nonce from the
environment is no harder than reading the old argv path, so this is partial mitigation, not a
boundary.

Raising the bar (this module, ``report_channel`` and ``tamper_scan``): when the verifier runs as
the owner (no verifier account) the nonce and the report destination no longer sit in the
environment. The parent hands the child two inherited file descriptors (``pass_fds``): a pipe
holding the nonce and an anonymous (already unlinked) file for the record; only their numbers
travel in ``CAIRNWORK_GUARD_FDS``. The plugin reads the nonce, closes that pipe and removes every
guard variable from ``os.environ`` when its module is imported, which is before any conftest or
test module (interpreter start-up hooks such as ``sitecustomize.py`` and ``.pth`` files run
earlier; they are protected verifier inputs a candidate cannot add). The parent reads the record
from its own descriptor, so there is no path to guess, replace or plant. Candidate patches are
also scanned for the APIs such a forgery needs (tamper_scan.py, reason ``VERIFIER_TAMPER_API``).
Both are a higher hurdle, not a boundary: a process that shares the interpreter can still scan its
open descriptors or build the API names from strings. Under a verifier account sudo closes
descriptors above 2, so that path keeps the environment hand-over (path and nonce); the plugin
removes it from ``os.environ`` once read, but the process's original environment stays readable
(``/proc/self/environ`` on Linux, ``KERN_PROCARGS2`` for the same uid on macOS), so on that path
the nonce is still within reach of the code under test.

A real boundary needs the verdict produced outside the candidate's process (a subprocess per
test, or an external observer), tracked as Tier-3 in the report-forgery research
(knowledge nexus/research/2026-10-20-forgeable-test-report.md).
