"""Deferred tests: the tests that prove a fix are applied only after the worker is done.

A task may name a ``test_commit``: a commit whose only parent is the task's base and
which adds or changes files under ``tests/`` only (no ``conftest.py``, regular files
only). The worker never gets it: its attempt clone holds the base. Cairnwork then

1. runs the verifiers on the test commit itself (base + tests) and requires a real
   failure there (base_comparison): tests that already pass prove nothing about the fix
   (REFUSED); a base that cannot run them cleanly (collection error, timeout, no sandbox,
   no report, a checkout the run changed) gives no evidence either way (UNCOMPARABLE, #234);
2. lays the test files over the worker's candidate in a private index and commits the
   result on top of it; that commit is what the verifiers run, Core notarises and a PR
   would carry (fix and tests together).

So the worker can neither read nor weaken the tests that judge it (the same idea as
SWE-bench applying its tests after the model's patch), as long as it cannot reach the
test commit elsewhere: the Issue runner never tells it the commit id. A test commit kept in
the private store (deferred_store.py) is on no remote at all; one pushed to a public branch
could still be found by a worker with network access.
