"""Run verifiers as a dedicated, unprivileged account (Issue #9 on macOS, #84 on Linux).

A sandbox alone is not complete read isolation: inside Seatbelt a process can still read
the arguments of other processes that run as the same user (sysctl KERN_PROCARGS2), and
under the Linux bwrap backend the whole root is bound read-only, so anything the running
account can read is readable. Running verifiers as a different, unprivileged account closes
both: the readable set becomes that account's, which owns nothing. The account is created by
scripts/setup_verifier_user.sh (macOS) or scripts/setup_verifier_user_linux.sh:

    sudo -n -u cairnwork-verifier -- <sandbox> /usr/bin/env -i <env> <python> -P -m pytest ...

where ``<sandbox>`` is sandbox-exec on macOS and bwrap on Linux (both from the backend).
The sudoers rule lets the owner run the sandbox binary, kill and rm as that account. The
sandbox binary takes any policy, so in effect any process running as the owner can run code
as the account: the account protects the owner from the verifier, not the other way round.
The account has no privileges of its own.

Every verifier process belongs to that account, so after each run ``kill -9 -1``
as the account ends all of them, including anything that started its own
session; any process found then fails the run. That is only safe if one verifier
runs at a time, so runs hold an exclusive lock, and each locked section starts by
making sure the account runs nothing.
