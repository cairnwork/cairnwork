"""Verify a candidate commit made elsewhere (another agent, CI) with the checks Cairnwork
applies to its own worker's output: one commit on the base that touches only the allowed
files (no deletion, symlink or submodule), the deferred tests laid over it, the verifiers
in the sandbox, and a Core verdict bound to the exact commit.

No worker runs and nothing is bound in the ownership ledger, so the deployer's in-flight
count never sees it. The run holds the shared run lock, as any run does, so ``recover``
cannot mistake its verifier processes for a dead run's. Like ``submit`` it is refused
while the state is drained (checked again once the run lock is held). Every check runs in
a scratch clone of the state's ``mirror`` (or of --repo-path when there is none) that this
run alone owns; the external candidate is fetched into the scratch clone only, never into
the shared mirror or the caller's repository. The Core record
goes to the state's notary under a one-off ``verify-`` task id.

A run marks itself with a locked file in ``<state>/verify-runs/``; the kernel drops the
lock when the run dies, so ``cleanup`` (also done at the start of every run) can tell a
dead run's leftovers (clones, baseline dirs, orphan processes) from a live run's.
