"""Isolated attempt clones and candidate checks (preserved behaviors #11-#13, #19).

Each attempt is a separate ``git clone --no-local`` with its own ``.git``
(objects, config, refs, index; no template files such as hook samples, #417),
detached at the task's base commit, with its ``origin`` remote removed so git
gives the worker no handle on Cairnwork's repository. Cairnwork's repository path must still not be
writable from the worker's sandbox: git cannot stop a process that already
has write access, and branch and tag protection relies on that. As a check on
the refs that matter for verification, ``collect_candidate`` refuses a
candidate when ``refs/replace/`` or another attempt's ``refs/cairnwork/`` ref
changed during the attempt; ordinary branch updates by Cairnwork are allowed.

The worker process must have exited before ``collect_candidate`` runs, and the
clone must not change afterwards: the checks describe the clone at that moment.

After the worker stops, ``collect_candidate`` fetches the clone's HEAD into
``refs/cairnwork/attempts/<attempt_id>`` and decides from Cairnwork's own
repository whether it is acceptable:

- exactly one new commit whose only parent is the base (#19);
- every changed path is in allowed_files, deletions only when allowed, and no
  symlinks or submodules are added or changed (#12);
- ``git diff --check`` finds no whitespace errors (#13);
- the clone's files are exactly the candidate's tree, compared in Python
  (see treecompare.py), so no git state in the clone can hide a leftover.

The only git command that touches the clone after the worker starts is that
fetch (git runs upload-pack in it). Any other state is a typed CandidateRejected.
