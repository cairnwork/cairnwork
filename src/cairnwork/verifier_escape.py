"""Tell a harmless launchd system daemon from a process the candidate left behind (cairnwork#37).

On a host with a full Xcode, running /usr/bin/git goes through xcrun/xcodebuild, and launchd starts
the account's own distnoted (ppid 1). It is harmless and killed with everything else, but
VerifierAccount must not count it as an escape. A process is exempt only by its REAL executable path
(proc_pidpath, never the forgeable argv[0]/ps-comm), its parent being launchd (ppid 1), and an Apple
code signature — so a candidate that renames itself to a daemon, or re-parents to launchd while
running another binary, keeps its own real path and is still counted.
