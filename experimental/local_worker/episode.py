"""Episode corpus record for the local worker loop (#88; EPISODE_CORPUS_SPEC_ZH §1-§6 + Plan v2).

Pure functions, no file I/O (corpus_io.py writes). One JSON line per episode, built from an
allowlist (redact.py): tool arguments keep a path only if it existed at base (any other path, and
one over 512 characters, becomes a digest with an allowlisted extension) and the test-target
index; written text (content, target, replacement) becomes ``{"sha256", "bytes"}``; tool outputs
keep only sizes, the truncation flag, the exit code and the error category. The task text, the
messages and every raw output stay in the private run directory. ``validate_record`` checks a
line against this frozen schema before it is appended.

Null versus zero (NULL_RULE): ``null`` means not observed, not applicable or not yet known (missing
``usage``, no cut, oracle fields before the post-step); ``0`` means observed and zero. A total is
null as soon as one of its parts is null; otherwise it equals the sum of the per-turn values.

The cut (Plan v2 point 4) comes from observed state: after every tool call the worker runs a fixed
``git status``; the cut is the first turn after which the tree differs from base (any path, tests
and docs included, side effects of run_tests included). Resuming from it is valid because every
turn before it left the tree at base.
