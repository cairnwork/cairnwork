"""Parsing the worker's two fixed git queries for the local worker loop (#88, Plan v2 point 4).

``status`` is ``git status --porcelain=v2 --branch -z -uall --renames --ignored=matching`` (ignored
files are listed too, so a write to an ignored path still changes the observed tree), followed by
what git cannot see: ``x d <path>`` for an empty directory and ``x o <path>`` for a FIFO or socket
(Claude review of #239, NB10), so creating one changes the observed tree too; ``numstat``
is one line, ``PATCH <added> <removed> <binary_files_changed>``, counted from the ``--text -U0``
patch against HEAD with untracked and ignored files included. Output that does not parse is never
guessed into a tree or a count: it is reported as not observed.
