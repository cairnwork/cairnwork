"""Minimal local agent loop for the local worker arm (#88, Plan v2 on the Issue).

The loop runs as the Owner and talks to one loopback chat endpoint (endpoint.py). It never opens a
file: every byte it hands the model is ``ToolCall.output`` from the worker tools (tools.py, each
call ``sudo -n -u _cairnwork_worker`` + Seatbelt), and the only file I/O of a run is corpus_io.py
(task.json, the canary report, the output directory). After every tool call the worker runs the
fixed ``status`` query; the observed tree decides the cut (episode.first_edit_cut).

Limits (frozen in the manifest): ``max_steps`` turns (one model reply plus at most one tool call;
extra tool calls in a reply are dropped and counted), one deadline for the whole episode
(``max_wall_seconds`` minus a cleanup reserve), and a context cap on the last reply's prompt +
completion tokens. Every endpoint request gets the deadline itself (endpoint.py: a watchdog, single
receives and a check after the read). Every wrapper call gets an absolute deadline too
(tools.WorkerTools.deadline): its timeout leaves room for the kill grace a timed-out call may still
use (tools.KILL_GRACE_SECONDS, SIGTERM then SIGKILL) and, for a tool action, for the sweep after it
with its own grace; both wrapper calls of edit_file share one timeout. A tool call ends by the loop
deadline; the status query after it, the sweep and numstat each get a third of the cleanup reserve,
and nothing runs past start + max_wall_seconds.

``run_tests`` takes no free-form arguments: it runs ``pytest -q --tb=short -- <targets>`` over the
task's declared public test targets, or the one the model picks by ``target_index``.

Once the loop starts, ``run`` never raises: a reply that breaks the tool-call structure
(agent_protocol.ProtocolError) and any unexpected error end the episode as a recorded ERROR_ABORT,
and the cleanup (sweep, numstat) always runs, in a ``finally``. The first SIGTERM/SIGINT (cli.py
installs ``interrupt``) stops the loop as "interrupted"; later ones are only counted
(``late_signals``, in the private transcript); a SystemExit is handed to the caller to re-raise
after the line is written (review of #239, NB8). A call the model can repair
(agent_protocol.BadCall: an unknown tool, a missing or extra argument) is an invalid_tool_call.
