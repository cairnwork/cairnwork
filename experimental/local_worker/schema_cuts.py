"""Schema checks of the two cuts of an episode line (#88; review findings 9-10, Codex B7).

Each cut object has cut_status CUT, NO_CUT or UNOBSERVED (its occurred flag True, False or null)
and must agree with the turns it was computed from: the edit cut is the first turn whose tool ran
and whose tree differs from base, unless a turn whose tool ran was never observed comes first
(UNOBSERVED); every pre-cut count is recomputed from the turns before the cut.
