"""Let a worker see its visible tests before it hands back (Issue #32; experimental, default off).

The Agy worker runs headless and cannot run commands, so it edits blind. ``VisibleTestsWorker``
wraps any worker (pipeline.Worker): after the inner worker's turn, Cairnwork itself runs the
task's *visible* verification commands on the edit and, if they do not all pass, gives the inner
worker another turn (up to ``retries`` of them) with a short pass/fail summary appended to its
instructions. The pipeline then judges the final clone exactly as without the wrapper.

Explicit opt-in only (council action 2, Issue #234): the product itself never retries, and the
A2 arm was not shown worth its cost (its one A/B interval included 0). So ``retries`` has no
default: a caller must pass a positive int (``VISIBLE_TESTS_NEEDS_RETRIES`` otherwise).

Usage record: every run of the wrapper writes ``<run_root>/<attempt>.visible-tests.json`` (beside
the clone and the ``-visible{turn}`` roots, never inside the clone), so the run's owner can see
afterwards whether and how the feedback was used. Fields, all counts or fixed strings and no
candidate-controlled text (no test, verifier or file names):

* ``schema``: 1
* ``feedback_source``: ``"visible-tests:pass-fail-only"`` or ``"visible-tests:account-detail"``
* ``retries``: the extra turns allowed
* ``extra_turns``: extra turns started (0..retries); a turn whose inner run raises still counts

What the probe reuses and what the worker can see:

* The edit is turned into a commit by ``snapshot.snapshot_candidate`` (the same code that makes the
  real candidate, so no git runs in the worker's clone) and run with ``verifiers.run_verifiers`` (a
  fresh checkout in the Seatbelt sandbox; no hand-rolled profile).
* Only verifiers whose every target file exists at the **base commit** are run. A task's deferred
  tests (``test_commit``) are never fetched, laid over or named: the probe touches only the base,
  the edit and Cairnwork's own repository (deferred_tests.never_seen still holds afterwards).
* The code under test runs inside the pytest process and can rewrite the guard's report, so every
  test name and outcome in it is **candidate-controlled text**. Without a VerifierAccount that
  code also runs as the owner's uid and can read other same-user processes' argv and environment
  (verifiers.py, "Known gap"), so any text it chooses could carry secrets into the next prompt.
  Hence:

  - no account: the wrapper refuses to be built unless ``pass_fail_only=True`` is passed, and then
    the summary is fixed wording only (verifier id from the task, passed or not; nothing else);
  - with an account: a test name is shown only if it starts with one of that verifier's target
    files and matches a strict ASCII charset; outcomes only from a fixed set; the cause only as
    fixed phrases (changed file names dropped); everything else is counted, never quoted.
  Residual channel in account mode (Issue #207, measured in the PR #204 round-2 review): the code
  under test can still choose names that pass the filter (charset and target-file prefix), so
  each turn's summary can carry up to MAX_NAMES x MAX_NAME_CHARS = 10 x 160 characters of text of
  its choosing. In the round-2 review's measurements that text could not carry other processes'
  secrets on this host: reading another uid's KERN_PROCARGS2 is EPERM for a non-root account,
  the setuid /bin/ps is denied under the Seatbelt profile, and require_idle keeps other account
  processes away while a probe runs. The only payload demonstrated was this run's own one-time
  nonce, which the run already holds; this is a measured result, not a proof.
  Still open before promotion (Issue #207): a check with a real verifier account, not the
  same-uid stand-in used in CI; and showing only node ids that the base version collects (one
  extra collect; judged not worth its cost, see the Issue).
* No log bytes ever reach the summary. The probe's checkouts and log directories (also under the
  account's run root, also when a run raises midway) and its attempt ref are removed before the
  next turn starts.

A probe failure (sandbox, account, git) propagates, so the pipeline records the attempt as
WORKER_FAILED rather than silently judging an unprobed edit. Not wired into any runner: a run
that wants it builds ``VisibleTestsWorker(AgyWorker(...), retries=1, account=...)`` itself; core
never imports this package.
